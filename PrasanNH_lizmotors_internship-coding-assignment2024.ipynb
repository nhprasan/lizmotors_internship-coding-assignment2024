    "- The first step involved understanding the requirements of the task, which included searching the internet for information (reference links attached at the end of the assignment).\n",
    "- After understanding the requirements, research was conducted to find suitable libraries and APIs for web scraping and internet search functionalities (DuckDuckGo Search API and BeautifulSoup library)\n",
    "- The Python script was implemented to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "    - Utilize the DuckDuckGo Search API to retrieve relevant links for the specified user queries.\n",
    "    - Scrape HTML data from the retrieved links using BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "    - Extract relevant information such as titles and content from the HTML data.\n",
    "    - Store the extracted data in a structured format (CSV file).\n",
    "- The script was tested with different queries to ensure that it could retrieve relevant data from different sources.\n",
    "- Comments and documentation were added to the code to explain its functionality and improve readability. The code was also cleaned up to remove any redundant or unnecessary parts."

       "  'Content': ' Canoo Inc. is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California, that develops and manufactures electric vehicles.[2][3] Canoo\\'s research & development team is based in Michigan, in the Detroit region (Auburn Hills, Livonia), and production operations are in Justin, Texas. The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4] Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future\\'s leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li \"David\" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7] In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10]  In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11] In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai\\'s Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87\\xa0billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14] In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause\\'s departure.[15][16] In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno\\'s Garage.[17] In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4\\xa0billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300\\xa0million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21] A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22] In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24] In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26] In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo\\'s trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]  On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600\\xa0hp (450\\xa0kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750\\xa0J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320\\xa0km) of range and a 1,800\\xa0lb (820\\xa0kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31] It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32] On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34] On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build \"pod-shaped vans it calls \\'lifestyle vehicles\\' beginning in 2023.\"[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38] On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December\\xa02022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40] In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7\\xa0million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an \"advanced industrialization facility\" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production. Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46] On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48] In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50] Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56] In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59]'},\n",

       "  'Content': 'Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue. Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career. Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes. (You can read the complete article here.) See you tomorrow. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte\\'s quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  \"Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,\" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of\\xa0State Street Global Advisors’s recent\\xa0Inflation Impact Survey. As\\xa0Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers. Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony\\'s international TV business. \"Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips.\" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (\"NGFMs\") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") rules.\\xa0 Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA \"EBITDA\" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor\\'s complete understanding of its operating performance.\\xa0 Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo\\'s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo\\'s computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo\\'s business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"target\" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.

       "  'Title': 'Canoo finds path to 2023 deliveries with Oklahoma facility lease',\n",
       "  'Content': 'EV startup Canoo has announced a long-term lease of an existing production facility in Oklahoma City, where it will operate a full and final assembly line for its flagship Lifestyle Vehicles (LVs). Today’s latest entry in the Canoo ($GOEV) saga should come as welcomed news for those rooting for the EV startup whose short, six-year tenure could be described as nothing short of a roller coaster ride of highs and lows. During its Q4 earnings released last week, Canoo put a $1.5 million bookend on an SEC investigation that alleged that certain former senior executives misled investors in late 2020 and early 2021 regarding the startup’s revenue projections. With that ordeal behind it, Canoo can focus on reaching scaled production of its LVs and Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDVs) with the $36.6 million remaining cash and equivalents it has as of December 31, 2022. With an ever-shrinking financial runway in front of it, Canoo continues to get scrappy in order to finally achieve long-promised scaled production in Oklahoma. Today’s news brings the startup a step closer, as it looks to enter its next phase of EV development. Here’s the latest. According to news out of the Canoo pressroom today, it has signed a long-term lease with AFV Partners to use its vehicle manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, OK. AFV is led by executive chairman and CEO Tony Aquila, who is also the current chairman and CEO of Canoo. Aquila spoke about Canoo’s progress in The Sooner State: One of the reasons we picked Oklahoma is because it has one of the most amazing workforces in America. They have proven themselves across many industries, including aviation and aero defense, which is why we are excited to announce our second manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, following our Vehicle Module Manufacturing Facility event on April 5, in Pryor, OK. I want to thank Mayor Holt and the people of Oklahoma City for welcoming us. To begin, Canoo will occupy 500,000 square feet of the 630,000 sq. ft. site which already offers easy access to road, rail, and waterways, plus plenty of room for expansion on over 120 acres. The newly leased site will help Canoo employ over 500 Oklahomans who will operate the startup’s full and final assembly lines, body shop, paint shop, quality control, and vehicle testing/validation. The lease in Oklahoma City will join a previously announced battery facility about 150 miles northeast in Pryor, OK – a facility that recently missed a construction deadline that negated up to $10 million in state incentives. Previously, Aquila said the newly announced Oklahoma operation would allow Canoo to get a much-needed jolt to produce electric vehicles while the factory in Pryor is being built. As a result, Canoo continues to zig-zag along its path toward scaled production, but funding remains a huge factor in its success. The company reported a net loss of $80.2 million for Q4 2022, totaling a loss of $487.7 million for the year. Looking ahead, Canoo expects operating expenses to be between $55 and $70 million with CAPEX between $30-$45 million in Q1 of 2023 as it enters the next stage of development. According to Aquila, the next phase will be “more focused on milestones versus event-based or just-in-time” that will “lower the cost, make more efficient use of capital, and allow us to focus on long term success.” In order to stay afloat, CFO Ken Magnet said Canoo is “exploring a number of diversified funding sources,” stating that the startup can now file for options like the Department of Energy’s loan program, now that the SEC investigation has been resolved. Canoo treks forward for now. Be sure to check back with Electrek for the latest updates. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

    "### Challenges Faced and Solutions:\n",
    "- Many websites have mechanisms to resist webpage crawling, causing them to be unresponsive to minimal scraping codes. Try/Except block was given to handling such errors during web scraping and also their Status Code is printed.\n",
    "- DuckDuckGo search results may vary over time due to various factors of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), making it challenging to focus on specific websites. Flexibility in handling dynamic search results is a requirement and hence focusing on specific websites may not make sense unless it is very very important.\n",
    "- Substandard HTML coding on websites may lead to scraping unwanted data. Special attention needs to be given to data cleaning techniques to ensure relevant information is extracted effectively.\n",
    "- Websites layouts and content evolve and change over time, making standard Python programs impractical in the long run. Continuous monitoring and adaptation of the scraping process needs to be done which is not sustainable or practical."
