"Identify the industry in which Canoo operates, along with its size, growth rate, trends, and key players.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoo,Canoo - Wikipedia," Canoo Inc. is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California, that develops and manufactures electric vehicles.[2][3] Canoo's research & development team is based in Michigan, in the Detroit region (Auburn Hills, Livonia), and production operations are in Justin, Texas. The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services.[4] Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer.[5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern.[6][7] In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive.[8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo.[9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company.[10]  In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle.[11] In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group, the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors, announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020.[12][13][14] In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure.[15][16] In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage.[17] In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion.[18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022.[19][20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV.[21] A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023.[22] In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project.[23][24] In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter.[25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly.[26] In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business,[27][28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors.[29]  On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck, an electric pickup set to release in 2023.[30][31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque.[30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity.[30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%.[31] It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles.[32] On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO.[33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders.[34] On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa) to manufacture all of their future vehicles.[35][36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023.""[36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market.[37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement.[38] On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there.[39] As of December 2022[update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters.[1][40] In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing.[41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production. Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma.[42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year.[43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor.[44]  In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs.[45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex.[46] On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program, with a total contract value of $147,855.[47][48] In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future.[49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice.[50] Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles, ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024.[51][52][53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order.[54][55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health.[56] In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.[57][58][59]"

"Identify the industry in which Canoo operates, along with its size, growth rate, trends, and key players.",https://fortune.com/2022/08/29/canoo-ev-startup-scored-deal-worlds-largest-retailer/,"Canoo, the EV startup that scored a deal with the world's largest retailer, is a mess under the hood | Fortune","Good morning, The push for the use of electric vehicles in the U.S. is ramping up. Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue. Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career. Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers. Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.

This gives the company more data and insights into its vehicles and data. Canoo will use Google Cloud's AI capabilities to surface trend data in vehicle fleets, providing fleet managers with information like whether vehicles need specific repairs, when route changes are happening due to road closures, or where efficiencies to driver schedules can be made.

"Identify the industry in which Canoo operates, along with its size, growth rate, trends, and key players.",https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/companies-executives/article/21263239/canoo-sticks-to-2023-production-target,Canoo Sticks to 2023 Production Target | IndustryWeek,"Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from  R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said. Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles. Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result. Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.” After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward  trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high."

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.

These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond Canoo's control. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business; the ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""  in Canoo's registration statement on Form S-1 filed on January 13, 2021, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC on or before March 31, 2021, as well as its other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or Canoo's assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release.

Learn More Electric vehicle start-up Canoo Holdings (GOEV -3.16%) said in conjunction with its third-quarter earnings report on Monday that it is accelerating its manufacturing plan and now expects to begin building vehicles at a factory in Oklahoma before the fourth quarter of 2022. Canoo reported a net loss of $80.9 million ($0.35 per share) for the third quarter, much of that attributable to research and development expenses and administrative spending. Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had, on average, expected a larger loss of $0.44 per share. The company had no revenue in the quarter, and none was expected. Texas-based Canoo is preparing to launch a series of electric vehicles based on its proprietary ""skateboard"" platform, which incorporates motors, batteries, suspension, and chassis structure into a single unit that is designed to be as flat as possible, to maximize the usable space inside the vehicle. Among the noteworthy points management made in the report: Canoo now expects to begin production of its first product, the electric Lifestyle Vehicle, before the fourth quarter of 2022. Image source: Canoo. Separately, management said that it has selected a site in Bentonville, Arkansas, for the company's headquarters, and a separate site in Fayetteville, Arkansas, for a research and development center, and that it is planning additional facilities near its factory in Oklahoma. CEO Tony Aquila said that the company expects more than incentives from the deals to build facilities in Arkansas and Oklahoma. ""In June, we announced Pryor, Oklahoma, as the location for our owned manufacturing facility,"" Aquila said. ""We have expanded this partnership to include Arkansas and additional locations in Oklahoma."" Aquila said that the new deals will bring Canoo about $100 million in incentives, on top of the roughly $300 million it has already received from Oklahoma. ""In addition, with these agreements, we are targeting approximately $100 million in vehicle orders with the states and universities where we are locating these facilities.""

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.  Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results  CANOO INC.

Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: Third Quarter Financial Highlights: Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows: See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP financial measures This press release includes certain adjusted financial measures (namely, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) that are non-GAAP financial measures (""NGFMs"") as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") rules.  Canoo believes these NGFMs provide useful information to investors as a supplement to its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The presentation of these NGFMs is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from NGFMs used by other companies, because all companies may not calculate NGFMs in the same fashion. In addition, these NGFMs are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NGFMs have limitations in that they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the NGFMs measures included in this press release to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Canoo believes Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of its operating performance.  Canoo believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating its performance, ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar NGFMs to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Canoo may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, Canoo's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Canoo's computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Canoo compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Canoo's business. Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, projections of market opportunity and market share, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches, potential success of, and ability to accelerate its, go-to-market strategy, and Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond Canoo's control. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business; the ability to issue equity or equity-linked securities, and those factors discussed  under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations""  in Canoo's registration statement on Form S-1 filed on January 13, 2021, and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 to be filed with the SEC on or before March 31, 2021, as well as its other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.  CANOO INC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial Results CANOO INC.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

Especially in California as the state just put a ban on gas-burning cars by 2035. Tony Aquila, the CEO of Canoo, a public EV company, is certain he can compete with brands like Tesla. But there’s one hurdle—Canoo hasn’t yet generated any revenue. Walmart signed an agreement with Canoo in July to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. But the company is “hanging on by a thread,” writes my colleague Jessica Mathews. “Inside the chaos at Canoo, the zero-revenue, cash-burning EV company that just inked a major deal with Walmart,” is Mathews’ new report that gives the scoop on the inner workings of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based startup. Canoo said in its Q2 2022 earnings report the company has “over $1 billion” in its sales pipeline. But it reported a net loss of $164.4 million, up from $112.6 million in Q2 of last year. On the Aug. 8 earnings call, Ramesh Murthy, interim CFO and chief accounting officer, talked about the “road to profitability.” Murthy said: “It’s becoming more clear to everyone that our philosophy on cash and access to capital is in line with what a technology-driven company would do. We are milestone and event focused on how we access capital on our road to profitability. By focusing on milestones and key events, we can drive sustainable value to the company and all our stakeholders.” Mathews interviewed Aquila in June and rode in one of Canoo’s futuristic electric campervans. “Canoo’s vehicles were still going through test programs and not yet on the market,” she writes. “Production wouldn’t begin until at least the end of 2022, and the company hadn’t started construction on its own manufacturing facilities. (The van we were sitting in was a prototype.)” She continues, “Canoo had just recently signed an agreement with hedge fund Yorkville Advisors to sell up to $250 million worth of its shares at a discount to their already depressed market price. The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company over its 2020 SPAC merger, and the company was tied up in three legal spats, including two class action lawsuits from retail investors in its shares. Indeed, right there in an SEC filing from March 31, Canoo itself had said it might not make it another year.” “And yet, Aquila—the tattooed, 57-year-old private-equity executive who had begun taking control of the company in 2020—looked me right in the eye when I asked about whether Canoo had the funding it needed for the next year. ‘I am a just-in-time capital guy,’ he assured me.” Mathews also discovered that Walmart’s purchase of yet-to-be-produced EVs is not the first financial boost that Aquila has received from the Walmart family in his career. Automakers are now required to steadily increase their sales of zero-emission cars in California, the nation’s largest auto market. And because 17 other states typically follow California’s auto-emissions standards, last week’s vote by the California Air Resources Board could reach far beyond the state, requiring the auto industry to speed up its switch to electric cars, Fortune reported. As the electric vehicle market continues to evolve, “Canoo is hardly the only EV startup to take investors and employees on a wild ride over the past couple of years,” Mathews writes. “Concern over climate change has lured an unprecedented amount of investor capital into the space, but the logistical challenges of launching an automaker from scratch haven’t gotten any less daunting.” But, “Crack open the hood even an inch, however, and it’s clear that, even with the Walmart deal, Canoo is floundering to an extreme degree,” Mathews writes.

Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Deloitte’s Q3 CFO Signals survey released today found that, overall, nearly half (46%) of CFOs expect the North American economy to be in recession by the new year. But it also varies by industry. For example, 67% of CFOs in the energy/resources industry expect a recession in North America by 2023, compared to 52% of CFOs in manufacturing, 50% in technology, 48% in financial services, and 25% in health care. CFOs are pursuing recession-proofing measures such as reducing operating expenses, controlling headcount, and reprioritizing capital expenditure. However, CFOs’ concerns over inflation vastly outweighed recession concerns. CFOs have lower expectations for year-over-year revenue growth— 6.2% this quarter, down from 7.8% in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations are at 6.4%, a decline from 8.4% in the prior quarter. The findings of Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey are based on a survey of 112 CFOs (74% from public companies and 26% from privately held firms). Respondents are from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the vast majority are from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.  ""Gen X is cutting back on everything because of inflation—except retirement savings,"" a Fortune report by Alicia Adamczyk, is an analysis of State Street Global Advisors’s recent Inflation Impact Survey. As Gen X gets closer to retirement, they’re “significantly” more concerned about rising prices than millennials or Baby Boomers. Dave McKinstray was named CFO at North America Cereal Co., the upcoming spinoff of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K). As announced in June 2022, Kellogg Company plans to separate three of its businesses—Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. McKinstray held several CFO roles throughout his nearly 15 years at Kellogg, such as CFO of the U.S. Snacks business and as CFO of U.S. Retail Sales before moving into his current role as VP of integrated business planning. His roles before Kellogg included positions in commodity risk management and trading. Christoph Pachler was named CFO at FaZe Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: FAZE) a lifestyle and media platform focused on gaming and youth culture, effective on or before October 3. Pachler has more than 25 years of financial management experience. Pachler joins FaZe Clan from Critical Content, an independent television studio in Los Angeles, where he served as managing director and CFO. Before Critical Content, Pachler was the EVP and CFO for Playboy Enterprises, a media and brand licensing company. Pachler previously spent 13 years in various expanding roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, where he was lastly the CFO and SVP for strategy and operations in Sony's international TV business. ""Inflation numbers can miss the mark on properly reflecting a country’s economic mood because these figures offer an incomplete picture of a country’s economic health. Consumer sentiment, on the other hand, reflects our attitudes about the current state of the economy and expectations about its trajectory. And by all accounts, consumer sentiment is at record lows–and its decline has been more protracted than during past dips."" —Christos A. Makridis, a professor, entrepreneur, and adviser who serves as an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, explained in a Fortune opinion piece that research shows consumer sentiment matters more than inflation and unemployment numbers.

"Analyze Canoo's main competitors, including their market share, products or services offered, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts.",https://asana.com/resources/competitive-analysis-example,Conduct a Competitive Analysis (With Examples) [2023] • Asana,"Competitive analysis involves identifying your direct and indirect competitors using research to reveal their strengths and weaknesses in relation to your own. In this guide, we’ll outline how to do a competitive analysis and explain how you can use this marketing strategy to improve your business. Whether you’re running a business or playing in a football game, understanding your competition is crucial for success. While you may not be scoring touchdowns in the office, your goal is to score business deals with clients or win customers with your products. The method of preparation for athletes and business owners is similar—once you understand your strengths and weaknesses versus your competitors’, you can level up. In this guide, we’ll outline the steps for a competitive analysis and explain how you can use this marketing strategy to improve your business. With our free competitor analysis template, you can identify who you’re up against and create a more insightful business plan. Competitive analysis involves identifying your direct and indirect competitors using research to reveal their strengths and weaknesses in relation to your own. Direct competitors market the same product to the same audience as you, while indirect competitors market the same product to a different audience. After identifying your competitors, you can use the information you gather to see where you stand in the market landscape. The purpose of this type of analysis is to get a competitive advantage in the market and improve your business strategy. Without a competitive analysis, it’s difficult to know what others are doing to win clients or customers in your target market. A competitive analysis report may include: A description of your company’s target market Details about your product or service versus the competitors’ Current and projected market share, sales, and revenues Pricing comparison Marketing and social media strategy analysis Differences in customer ratings You’ll compare each detail of your product or service versus the competition to assess strategy efficacy. By comparing success metrics across companies, you can make data-driven decisions. Follow these five steps to create your competitive analysis report and get a broad view of where you fit in the market. This process can help you analyze a handful of competitors at one time and better approach your target customers. In step one, select between five and 10 competitors to compare against your company. The competitors you choose should have similar product or service offerings and a similar business model to you. You should also choose a mix of both direct and indirect competitors so you can see how new markets might affect your company. Choosing both startup and seasoned competitors will further diversify your analysis. Tip: To find competitors in your industry, use Google or Amazon to search for your product or service. The top results that emerge are likely your competitors. If you’re a startup or you serve a niche market, you may need to dive deeper into the rankings to find your direct competitors. Once you know the competitors you want to analyze, you’ll begin in-depth market research. This will be a mixture of primary and secondary research. Primary research comes directly from customers or the product itself, while secondary research is information that’s already compiled. Then, keep track of the data you collect in a user research template. Primary market research may include: Purchasing competitors’ products or services Interviewing customers Conducting online surveys of customers Holding in-person focus groups Secondary market research may include: Examining competitors’ websites Assessing the current economic situation Identifying technological developments Reading company records Tip: Search engine analysis tools like Ahrefs and SEMrush can help you examine competitors’ websites and obtain crucial SEO information such as the keywords they’re targeting, the number of backlinks they have, and the overall health of their website. The next step in your analysis involves a comparison of your product to your competitors’ products. This comparison should break down the products feature by feature. While every product has its own unique features, most products will likely include: Price Service offered Age of audience served Number of features Style and design Ease of use Type and number of warranties Customer support offered Product quality Tip: If your features table gets too long, abbreviate this step by listing the features you believe are of most importance to your analysis. Important features may include cost, product benefits, and ease of use. The next step in your analysis will look similar to the one before, except you’ll compare the marketing efforts of your competitors instead of the product features. Unlike the product features matrix you created, you’ll need to go deeper to unveil each company’s marketing plan. Areas you’ll want to analyze include: Social media Website copy Paid ads Press releases Product copy As you analyze the above, ask questions to dig deeper into each company’s marketing strategies. The questions you should ask will vary by industry, but may include: What story are they trying to tell? What value do they bring to their customers? What’s their company mission? What’s their brand voice? Tip: You can identify your competitors’ target demographic in this step by referencing their customer base, either from their website or from testimonials. This information can help you build customer personas. When you can picture who your competitor actively targets, you can better understand their marketing tactics. Competitive intelligence will make up a significant part of your competitor analysis framework, but once you’ve gathered your information, you can turn the focus back to your company. A SWOT analysis helps you identify your company’s strengths and weaknesses. It also helps turn weaknesses into opportunities and assess threats you face based on your competition. During a SWOT analysis, ask yourself: What do we do well? What could we improve? Are there market gaps in our services? What new market trends are on the horizon? Tip: Your research from the previous steps in the competitive analysis will help you answer these questions and fill in your SWOT analysis. You can visually present your findings in a SWOT matrix, which is a four-box chart divided by category. The last step in your competitive analysis is to understand where you stand in the market landscape. To do this, you’ll create a graph with an X and Y axis. The two axes should represent the most important factors for being competitive in your market. For example, the X-axis may represent customer satisfaction, while the Y-axis may represent presence in the market. You’ll then plot each competitor on the graph according to their (x,y) coordinates. You’ll also plot your company on this chart, which will give you an idea of where you stand in relation to your competitors. This graph is included for informational purposes and does not represent Asana’s market landscape or any specific industry’s market landscape. Tip: In this example, you’ll see three companies that have a greater market presence and greater customer satisfaction than yours, while two companies have a similar market presence but higher customer satisfaction. This data should jumpstart the problem-solving process because you now know which competitors are the biggest threats and you can see where you fall short. Imagine you work at a marketing startup that provides SEO for dentists, which is a niche industry and only has a few competitors. You decide to conduct a market analysis for your business. To do so, you would: Step 1: Use Google to compile a list of your competitors. Steps 2, 3, and 4: Use your competitors’ websites, as well as SEO analysis tools like Ahrefs, to deep-dive into the service offerings and marketing strategies of each company. Step 5: Focusing back on your own company, you conduct a SWOT analysis to assess your own strategic goals and get a visual of your strengths and weaknesses. Step 6: Finally, you create a graph of the market landscape and conclude that there are two companies beating your company in customer satisfaction and market presence. After compiling this information into a table like the one below, you consider a unique strategy. To beat out your competitors, you can use localization. Instead of marketing to dentists nationwide like your competitors are doing, you decide to focus your marketing strategy on one region, state, or city. Once you’ve become the known SEO company for dentists in that city, you’ll branch out. You won’t know what conclusions you can draw from your competitive analysis until you do the work and see the results. Whether you decide on a new pricing strategy, a way to level up your marketing, or a revamp of your product, understanding your competition can provide significant insight. There are some drawbacks to competitive analysis you should consider before moving forward with your report. While these drawbacks are minor, understanding them can make you an even better manager or business owner. You don’t just want to gather the information from your competitive analysis—you also want to take action on that information. The data itself will only show you where you fit into the market landscape. The key to competitive analysis is using it to problem solve and improve your company’s strategic plan. Confirmation bias means interpreting information based on the beliefs you already hold. This is bad because it can cause you to hold on to false beliefs. To avoid bias, you should rely on all the data available to back up your decisions. In the example above, the business owner may believe they’re the best in the SEO dental market at social media. Because of this belief, when they do market research for social media, they may only collect enough information to confirm their own bias—even if their competitors are statistically better at social media. However, if they were to rely on all the data available, they could eliminate this bias. A competitive analysis report represents a snapshot of the market landscape as it currently stands. This report can help you gain enough information to make changes to your company, but you shouldn’t refer to the document again unless you update the information regularly. Market trends are always changing, and although it’s tedious to update your report, doing so will ensure you get accurate insight into your competitors at all times. Learning your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses will make you a better marketer. If you don’t know the competition you’re up against, you can’t beat them. Using competitive analysis can boost your marketing strategy and allow you to capture your target audience faster. Competitive analysis must lead to action, which means following up on your findings with clear business goals and a strong business plan. Once you do your competitive analysis, you can use the templates below to put your plan into action. "
"Analyze Canoo's main competitors, including their market share, products or services offered, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts.",https://www.coursera.org/articles/competitor-analysis,What Is Competitor Analysis? Definition + Step-by-Step Guide  | Coursera,"Discover what goes into competitor analysis, how it benefits your business, and the steps to conducting a competitor analysis. A competitor analysis, also called competitive analysis and competition analysis, is the process of examining similar brands in your industry to gain insight into their offerings, branding, sales, and marketing approaches. Knowing your competitors in business analysis is important if youâre a business owner, marketer, start-up founder, or product developer. A competitor analysis offers several benefits, including:Â  Understanding industry standards so that you can meet and exceed themÂ Â Â Discovering untapped niche marketsÂ Â Differentiating products and services Fulfilling customersâ desires and solving their problems better than competitors Distinguishing your brand Standing out in your marketingÂ Measuring your growthÂ The sections below provide a competitor analysis framework for evaluating your industryâs competitive landscape. Return to this framework regularly and apply the insights to develop your business. Start by reviewing your own business values, goals, branding, products, and services. That way, you can easily identify existing brands that target customers might choose over yours.Â Â Next, turn to Google. Type in your product name or category. What brands and companies come up when you search ""hydrating lipstick"", for example? What comes up when you search social media channels for relevant hashtags or keywords? Using the information you gathered, make a list of up to 10 brands whose offerings most resemble yours and present your target customers with comparable alternatives. Identify potential direct competitors (those who sell a similar product to a similar audience) and indirect competitors (those who sell a different product to a similar audience).  By examining how competitors structure their businesses, you can gauge how equipped they are to grow, gain market share, and earn customer loyalty in your target market. Review each competitorâs website and social media profile to gather the following information:Â  How large is the company, in terms of the number of leaders and employees? How many years has the company been in operation?Â What job openings do these companies list on Glassdoor, Indeed, or LinkedIn? What are their areas of expansion? For publicly traded companies, you may be able to review their annual reports and gain insight into how much revenue theyâre generating, their debt and liability, and other performance metrics.  A value proposition is a short statement that summarizes the benefits of a product and why a customer would choose it over competing products. A value proposition often looks something like the following: We help [target customer] do [outcome, benefit, experience] by doing / offering [product or service]. Â  In this section, you will understand competitorsâ value propositions in order to ensure your product or service stands out in the marketplace. Review major competitorsâ site copy, particularly on the ""About"" or What We Do"" pages, as well as analyzing any blogs and stories on their website. Answer these questions for each competitor:Â  What problems and pain points do competitorsâ products solve?Â What desires do the products fulfill?Â What benefits or outcomes does the product deliver for customers? What data do they cite to support their claims about productsâ benefits? What pricing structure do competitors use?Â      Evaluate how competitors position themselves in the marketplace. This will allow you to create a marketing strategy that gets your brand in front of your target audience.Â  For each competitor, answer these questions:Â  What social media influencers does this company partner with to leverage their authority, authentic content, and personal connections to target customers?Â Â  What affiliate marketing or brand ambassador programs does this company offer to leverage the recommendations of satisfied customers?Â  What kind of digital or traditional paid advertising presence does this company have? On what marketing channels do competitors publish organic content, including websites, landing pages, social media platforms, and email?Â  What type of content do you see, including articles, videos, ebooks, reports, commercials, and digital ads?Â Â Read more: Marketing Strategy: What It Is and How to Create One Get to know your competitors by auditing their brand identities and getting a sense of why customers might feel connected (and loyal) to that brand.  For each competitor, answers these questions:Â  If this company were a person, how would you describe its personality?Â What words, phrases, tone, and style does this company use in its messaging?Â Â What values do competitors communicate through their messaging?Â How would you describe the visual elements of this companyâs branding? And how do those elements correspond to the brandâs values, voice, and personality?Â What emotions do the brand elements evoke in customers?Â  Read more: What Is a Brand Strategy? And How to Create One  Study the customer journeys that your competitors have set up to nurture and convert customers. Your goal is to gauge how seamless, integrated, and logical it is to go from the first touchpoint to making a purchase and beyond.Â Â Â  Start by following your competitors on social media, subscribing to them via email, and purchasing products and services to experience each customer journey for yourself.Â  As you experience the customer journey for each competitor, gather information on the following:Â   What are the different touchpoints along this companyâs customer journey? What elements make it easy to keep moving along the customer journey?Â What calls to action and instructions are there to make it clear how to proceed? What kinds of content educate and entertain you at each touchpoint? What elements create friction or make it difficult to advance to the next step? What do you experience after subscribing or making a purchase? Do you find customer support, upsells, and access to a community?Â In this step, you will scour competitorsâ customer reviews, reactions, and comments on their social media posts, social media mentions, media appearances, and even employee reviews on job sites to understand the perception of competitors in the marketplace. With this information, you can strategize how to garner a positive reputation for your brand, learn from competitorsâ mistakes and challenges, and work to avoid any pitfalls yourself.Â  For each competitor, explore the following:  How do followers and subscribers interact with this companyâs public content? What is the general public sentiment regarding this company, based on mentions, product reviews, and social media likes and comments? Include praise as well as complaints.Â What experiences do employees have, based on reviews on job sites like Glassdoor and Indeed?Â  Share of voice measures how much of the market your brand owns compared to competitors. By determining the share of voice, you can gauge how visible, authoritative, and popular your brand is in the marketplace.  A SWOT analysis is a classic exercise for identifying the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats that exist within the competitive landscape. Conduct a SWOT analysis of your competitors to consolidate everything youâve learned into a succinct story. Â What strengths do you see in competitorsâ branding, marketing, customer journeys, and products? What weaknesses do you see in competitorsâ branding, marketing, customer journeys, and products? What opportunities do you see for your business to capitalize on? What is your competition doing that might pose a threat to your business?  You can also list the strengths and weaknesses of your business as it currently stands and compare them side-by-side with those of competitors.Â  Â For more on SWOT analysis, watch this video from the Business Strategy Specialization:   Once youâve conducted a competitor analysis, your next step is to apply the insights to your business. Use the following prompts to differentiate your brand, products, and services from competitors and gain market share:  What product features can you add that differentiate your product from competitors? What pricing strategy can you use to attract new customers to your offerings? What design features can you add to your brand to make it stand out? How can you compose a value proposition that stands out from competitors? We help [target customer] do [outcome, benefit, experience] by doing / offering [product or service]. Â How can you design a more seamless, frictionless customer journey that leads consumers to make a purchase and become loyal brand ambassadors?Â How can you create content that improves on that of your competitors, including covering new topics, addressing ignored pain points, recommending new solutions, and offering more exciting experiences?Â Â How can you improve your social media strategy to reach new potential customers? What approaches can you take on marketing channels where your competitors have a presence to distinguish your messaging and present your offerings as the best choice? On which marketing channels do your competitors not (yet) have a presence? What steps can you take to establish and grow a presence on those channels?Â Remember that conducting a competitor analysis is a crucial step in developing your business. It can help you differentiate your brand and present your products and services as the best on the market. Return to your competitor analysis efforts regularly, such as every quarter, six months, or year, to account for shifts in competitorsâ tactics and new competitors that arrive on the scene. Always look for ways to give your brand and products a competitive edge.Â Keep learning about marketing and its role in business with the top-rated courses and Professional Certificates on Coursera: Stay on top of your industryâs evolution by enrolling in the University of Virginia's Business Strategy Specialization.

    November 10, 2022 Track and analyze your competitors with these ten free planning templates. When was the last time you ran a competitive analysis for your brand? And most importantly, do you know how to do one efficiently? If you‘re unsure or if the last ""analysis"" you ran was a quick perusal of a competitor’s website, you're likely missing out on important intelligence that could help your brand grow.  In this detailed guide, you'll learn how to conduct a competitive analysis to give your business an advantage. Table of Contents  A competitive analysis is a strategy that involves researching major competitors to gain insight into their products, sales, and marketing tactics. Implementing stronger business strategies, warding off competitors, and capturing market share are just a few benefits of conducting a competitive market analysis.  A competitive analysis can help you learn the ins and outs of how your competition works and identify potential opportunities where you can outperform them. It also enables you to stay atop of industry trends and ensure your product is consistently meeting — and exceeding — industry standards. Let's dive into a few more benefits of conducting competitive analyses: Competitive analysis is a meticulous strategy that dives deep into the operations of your prime competitors. It's not just about knowing what they offer. You need to understand their sales strategies, marketing tactics, and the ethos driving their brand. Track and analyze your competitors with these ten free planning templates. Click this link to access this resource at any time. The ripple effects of a well-executed competitive analysis are manifold: While it's essential to understand how your competition operates, the real magic happens when you can: Competitive market research is a vital exercise that goes beyond merely comparing products or services. It involves an in-depth analysis of the market metrics that distinguish your offerings from those of your competitors. A thorough market research doesn't just highlight these differences but leverages them, laying a solid foundation for a sales and marketing strategy that truly differentiates your business in a bustling market. In the next section, we’ll explore the nuts and bolts of conducting a detailed competitive analysis tailored to your brand. Every brand can benefit from regular competitor analysis. By performing a competitor analysis, you'll be able to: As you can see, learning any of these four components will lead your brand down the path of achievement. Next, let's dive into some steps you can take to conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis.    To run a complete and effective competitive analysis, use these ten templates, which range in purpose from sales to marketing to product strategy.  Download Now First, you‘ll need to figure out who you’re competing with to compare the data accurately. What works in a business like yours may not work for your brand. So how can you do this? Divide your “competitors” into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct competitors are businesses that offer a product or service that could pass as a similar substitute for yours and that operate in your same geographic area. On the flip side, an indirect competitor provides products that are not the same but could satisfy the same customer need or solve the same problem. It seems simple enough on paper, but these two terms are often misused. When comparing your brand, you should only focus on your direct competitors. This is something many brands get wrong. Let's use an example: Stitch Fix and Fabletics are both subscription-based services that sell clothes on a monthly basis and serve a similar target audience. But as we look deeper, we can see that the actual product (clothes in this case) is not the same; one brand focuses on stylish everyday outfits while the other is workout-centric attire only. Yes, these brands satisfy the same need for women (having trendy clothes delivered right to their doorstep each month), but they do so with completely different types of clothing, making them indirect competitors. This means Kate Hudson‘s team at Fabletics would not want to spend their time studying Stitch Fix too closely since their audiences probably vary quite a bit. Even if it’s only slightly, this tiny variation is enough to make a big difference. Now, this doesn't mean you should toss your indirect competitors out the window completely. Keep these brands on your radar since they could shift positions at any time and cross over into the direct competitor zone. Using our example, Stitch Fix could start a workout line, which would certainly change things for Fabletics. This is also one of the reasons why you‘ll want to routinely run a competitor analysis. The market can and will shift at any time, and if you’re not constantly scoping it out, you won‘t be aware of these changes until it’s too late. Track and analyze your competitors with these ten free planning templates. Click this link to access this resource at any time. At the heart of any business is its product or service, which is what makes this a good place to start. You‘ll want to analyze your competitor’s complete product line and the quality of the products or services they're offering. You should also take note of their pricing and any discounts they're offering customers. Some questions to consider include: Running a sales analysis of your competitors can be a bit tricky. You'll want to track down the answers to questions such as: These helpful pieces of information will give you an idea of how competitive the sales process is and what information you need to prepare your sales reps with to compete during the final buy stage. For publicly held companies, you can find annual reports online, but you'll have to do some sleuthing to find this info from privately owned businesses. You could find some of this information by searching through your CRM and reaching out to those customers who mentioned they were considering your competitor. Find out what made them choose your product or service over others out there. To do this, run a report that shows all prospective deals where there was an identified competitor. If this data is not something you currently record, talk to marketing and sales to implement a system where prospects are questioned about the other companies they are considering. Essentially, they‘ll need to ask their leads (either through a form field or during a one-on-one sales conversation) to identify who their current service providers are, who they’ve used in the past, and who else they are considering during the buying process. When a competitor is identified, have your sales team dive deeper by asking why they are considering switching to your product. If you've already lost the deal, be sure to follow up with the prospect to determine why you lost to your competitor. What services or features attracted the prospect? Was it about price? What‘s the prospect’s impression of your sales process? If they've already made the switch, find out why they made this decision. By asking open-ended questions, you'll have honest feedback about what customers find appealing about your brand and what might be turning customers away. Once you‘ve answered these questions, you can start scoping out your competitor’s marketing efforts. There are a few major factors that go into correctly pricing your product — and one major one is understanding how much your competitors are charging for a similar product or service. If you feel your product offers superior features compared to those of a competitor, you might consider making your product or service more expensive than industry standards. However, if you do that, you'll want to ensure your sales reps are ready to explain why your product is worth the additional cost. Alternatively, perhaps you feel there‘s a gap in your industry for affordable products. If that’s the case, you might aim to charge less than competitors and appeal to prospects who aren't looking to break the bank for a high-quality product. Of course, other factors go into correctly pricing a product, but it‘s critical you stay on top of industry pricing to ensure you’re pricing your product in a way that feels reasonable to prospects. Additionally, take a look at any perks your competitors offer and how you might match those perks to compete. For instance, perhaps your competitors offer a major referral discount or a month-long free trial version. These perks could be the reason you‘re losing customers, so if it feels reasonable for your brand, consider where you might match those perks — or provide some unique perks of your own if competitors don’t offer any. Did you know expensive shipping is the number one reason for cart abandonment? Nowadays, free shipping is a major perk that can attract consumers to choose one brand over another. If you work in an industry where shipping is a major factor — like e-commerce — you‘ll want to take a look at competitors’ shipping costs and ensure you're meeting (if not exceeding) those prices. If most of your competitors offer free shipping, you‘ll want to look into the option for your own company. If free shipping isn’t a practical option for your business, consider how you might differentiate in other ways — including loyalty programs, holiday discounts, or giveaways on social media. Track and analyze your competitors with these ten free planning templates. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Analyzing your competitor's website is the fastest way to gauge their marketing efforts. Take note of any of the following items and copy down the specific URL for future reference: Then, take a look at the quantity of these items. Do they have several hundred blog posts or a small handful? Are there five white papers and just one e-book? Next, determine the frequency of these content assets. Are they publishing something new each week or once a month? How often does a new e-book or case study come out? Chances are, if you come across a robust archive of content, your competitor has been publishing regularly. Depending on the topics they're discussing, this content may help you hone in on their lead-generating strategies. From there, you should move on to evaluating the quality of their content. After all, if the quality is lacking, it won‘t matter how often they post since their target audience won’t find much value in it. Choose a small handful of samples to review instead of tackling every single piece to make the process more manageable. Your sampler should include content pieces covering a variety of topics, so you'll have a fairly complete picture of what your competitor shares with their target audience. When analyzing your competitor's content, consider the following questions: As you continue to scan the content, pay attention to the photos and imagery your competitors are using. Do you quickly scroll past generic stock photos, or are you impressed by custom illustrations and images? If they're using stock photos, do they at least have overlays of text quotes or calls-to-action that are specific to their business? If their photos are custom, are they sourced from outside graphic professionals, or do they appear to be done in-house? When you have a solid understanding of your competitor‘s content marketing strategy, it’s time to find out if it's truly working for them. Understanding what types of technology your competitors use can be critical for helping your own company reduce friction and increase momentum within your organization. For instance, perhaps you‘ve seen positive reviews about a competitor’s customer service — as you're conducting research, you learn the customer uses powerful customer service software you haven't been taking advantage of. This information should arm you with the opportunity to outperform your competitors' processes. To figure out which software your competitors use, type the company's URL into Built With, an effective tool for unveiling what technology your competitors' site runs on, along with third-party plugins ranging from analytics systems to CRMs. Alternatively, you might consider looking at competitors' job listings, particularly for engineer or web developer roles. The job listing will likely mention which tools a candidate needs to be familiar with — a creative way to gain intel into the technology your competitors use. To gauge how engaging your competitor‘s content is to their readers, you’ll need to see how their target audience responds to what they're posting. Check the average number of comments, shares, and likes on your competitor's content and find out if: From engagement, you‘ll move right along to your competitor’s content promotion strategy. The following questions can also help you prioritize and focus on what to pay attention to: The last area you‘ll want to evaluate when it comes to marketing is your competitor’s social media presence and engagement rates. How does your competition drive engagement with their brand through social media? Do you see social sharing buttons with each article? Does your competitor have links to their social media channels in the header, footer, or somewhere else? Are these clearly visible? Do they use calls-to-action with these buttons? If your competitors are using a social network that you may not be on, it's worth learning more about how that platform may be able to help your business, too. To determine if a new social media platform is worth your time, check your competitor's engagement rates on those sites. First, visit the following sites to see if your competition has an account on these platforms: Then, take note of the following quantitative items from each platform: With the same critical eye you used to gauge your competition's content marketing strategy, take a fine-toothed comb to analyze their social media strategy. What kind of content are they posting? Are they more focused on driving people to landing pages, resulting in new leads? Or are they posting visual content to promote engagement and brand awareness? How much of this content is original? Do they share curated content from other sources? Are these sources regular contributors? What is the overall tone of the content? How does your competition interact with its followers? How frequently do their followers interact with their content? After you collect this data, generate an overall grade for the quality of your competitor's content. This will help you compare the rest of your competitors using a similar grading scale. As you evaluate each component in your competitor analysis (business, sales, and marketing), get into the habit of performing a simplified SWOT analysis at the same time. This means you‘ll take note of your competitor’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats any time you assess an overall grade. Some questions to get you started include: You‘ll be able to compare their weaknesses against your strengths and vice versa. By doing this, you can better position your company, and you’ll start to uncover areas for improvement within your own brand.

Product analysis drills down to discover key differences and similarities in products that share the same general market. If you have a competitor selling products in a similar market niche to your own — you want to ensure that you aren’t losing market share to the competition. Leveraging the example above, we can drill down and discover some of the key differentiators in product offerings.  The first step in any product analysis is to assess current pricing. Nintendo offers three models of its Switch console: The smaller lite version is priced at $199, the standard version is $299, and the new OLED version is $349. Sony, meanwhile, offers two versions of its PlayStation 5 console: The standard edition costs $499, and the digital version, which doesn’t include a disc drive, is $399. Next is a comparison of key features. In the case of our console example, this means comparing features like processing power, memory, and hard drive space. Feature PS5 Standard Nintendo Switch Hard drive space 825 GB 32 GB RAM 16 GB 4 GB USB ports 4 ports 1 USB 3.0, 2 USB 2.0 Ethernet connection Gigabit None With basic features compared, it’s time to dive deeper with differentiators. While a glance at the chart above seems to indicate that the PS5 is outperforming its competition, this data only tells part of the story. Here’s why: The big selling point of the standard and OLED Switch models is that they can be played as either handheld consoles or docked with a base station connected to a TV. What’s more, this “switching” happens seamlessly, allowing players to play whenever, wherever. The Playstation offering, meanwhile, has leaned into market-exclusive games that are only available on its system to help differentiate them from their competitors. Step 4: Identify market gaps The last step in a competitive product analysis is looking for gaps in the market that could help your company get ahead. When it comes to the console market, one potential opportunity gaining traction is the delivery of games via cloud-based services rather than physical hardware. Companies like Nvidia and Google have already made inroads in this space, and if they can overcome issues with bandwidth and latency, it could change the market at scale. How do you stack up against the competition? Where are you similar, and what sets you apart? This is the goal of competitive analysis. By understanding where your brand and competitors overlap and diverge, you’re better positioned to make strategic decisions that can help grow your brand. Of course, it’s one thing to understand the benefits of competitive analysis, and it’s another to actually carry out an analysis that yields actionable results. Don’t worry — we’ve got you covered with a quick example. Let’s take a look at popular gaming system companies Sony and Nintendo. Sony’s newest offering — the Playstation 5 — recently hit the market but has been plagued by supply shortages. Nintendo’s Switch console, meanwhile, has been around for several years but remains a consistent seller, especially among teens and children. This scenario is familiar for many companies on both sides of the coin; some have introduced new products designed to compete with established market leaders, while others are looking to ensure that reliable sales don’t fall. Using some of the steps listed above, here’s a quick competitive analysis example. In our example, it’s Sony vs Nintendo, but it’s also worth considering Microsoft’s Xbox, which occupies the same general market vertical. This is critical for effective analysis; even if you’re focused on specific competitors and how they compare, it’s worth considering other similar market offerings. PlayStation offers two PS5 versions, digital and standard, at different price points, while Nintendo offers three versions of its console. Both companies also sell peripherals — for example, Sony sells virtual reality (VR) add-ons, while Nintendo sells gaming peripherals such as steering wheels, tennis rackets, and differing controller configurations. When it comes to sales tactics and marketing, Sony and Nintendo have very different approaches. In part thanks to the recent semiconductor shortage, Sony has driven up demand via scarcity — very low volumes of PS5 consoles remain available. Nintendo, meanwhile, has adopted a broader approach by targeting families as its primary customer base. This effort is bolstered by the Switch Lite product line, which is smaller and less expensive, making it a popular choice for children. The numbers tell the tale: Through September 2021, Nintendo sold 14.3 million consoles, while Sony sold 7.8 million. Sony has the higher price point: Their standard PS5 sells for $499, while Nintendo’s most expensive offering comes in at $349. Both offer robust digital marketplaces and the ability to easily download new games or services. Here, the key differentiators are flexibility and fidelity. The Switch is flexible — users can dock it with their television and play it like a standard console or pick it up and take it anywhere as a handheld gaming system. The PS5, meanwhile, has superior graphics hardware and processing power for gamers who want the highest-fidelity experience. If you compare the marketing efforts of Nintendo and Sony, the difference is immediately apparent: Sony’s ads feature realistic in-game footage and speak to the exclusive nature of their game titles. The company has managed to secure deals with several high-profile game developers for exclusive access to new and existing IPs. Nintendo, meanwhile, uses brightly lit ads showing happy families playing together or children using their smaller Switches while traveling. Engagement helps drive sales and encourage repeat purchases. While there are several ways to measure engagement, social media is one of the most straightforward: In general, more followers equates to more engagement and greater market impact. When it comes to our example, Sony enjoys a significant lead over Nintendo: While the official Playstation Facebook page has 38 million followers, Nintendo has just 5 million. Competitive analysis is complex, especially when you’re assessing multiple companies and products simultaneously. To help streamline the process, we’ve created 10 free templates that make it possible to see how you stack up against the competition — and what you can do to increase market share. Let’s break down our SWOT analysis template. Here’s what it looks like:  Download Free Templates Strengths. Identify your strengths. These may include specific pieces of intellectual property, products that are unique to the market, or a workforce that outperforms the competition. Weaknesses. Here, it’s worth considering potential issues around pricing, leadership, staff turnover, and new competitors in the market. Opportunities. This part of the SWOT analysis can focus on new market niches, evolving consumer preferences, or new technologies being developed by your company. Threats. These might include new taxes or regulations on existing products or an increasing number of similar products in the same market space that could negatively affect your overall share. A competitive analysis framework is a structured approach used to evaluate potential competitors and understand their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This framework serves as a guide for businesses to identify competitive advantages, understand market positioning, and inform strategic decisions. Depending on the industry and the company's objectives, this framework might focus on areas like product features, market share, pricing, customer feedback, and more. Conducting a thorough competitive analysis involves several steps: The five key components of a competitive analysis include: The 3 C's refer to a strategic model that considers three main factors when understanding the broader business environment: Yes, SWOT analysis is a type of competitive analysis. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It is a strategic planning tool used to identify and analyze these four elements of a business. While a SWOT analysis can be focused internally on a company‘s own attributes, when used as a competitive analysis tool, it assesses a competitor’s SWOT to understand where your business has advantages or might be vulnerable. Before you accurately compare your competition, you need to establish a baseline. This also helps when it comes time to perform a SWOT analysis. Take an objective look at your business, sales, and marketing reports through the same metrics you use to evaluate your competition. Record this information just like you would with a competitor and use this as your baseline to compare across the board.

It’s particularly hard (and confusing and incredibly time-consuming) if you’re relatively new in business. Most of the data is ridiculously difficult to get. Even if you manage to dig something up, you always seem to be left with more questions than answers. How did they manage to get $10M in funding? Did that absurdly expensive ad campaign pay off? Did their CEO leave because things aren’t going well at the company? What does it all mean? At least that’s what I felt when I was just getting started with competitive analysis. Whether you’re facing a similar struggle or just aren’t sure where to start, I hope this article will help you navigate through every step of the process. In this article, I will share the competitive analysis framework my team and I have developed (through weeks of research and dozens of iterations), and give you some tips on where to look for data that isn’t publicly available so you can have a competitive advantage. But before we start… Competitor analysis is the process of evaluating your direct competitors’ companies, products, and marketing strategies. To make your analysis truly useful, it’s important to: Which brings us to why competitor analysis is worth doing in the first place. This framework will work well for entrepreneurs, business owners, startup founders, product managers, creators, and marketers. It covers business metrics, a product analysis, and a marketing assessment, with the marketing bit being a little more in-depth. Feel free to skip certain parts if you’re only interested in one aspect, or better yet, delegate some steps to respective teams if you can. It doesn’t matter much what kind of product you’re selling or how mature your business is. To use this framework, you may already have a fully functional product, an MVP, or even just a product idea. I’ll be using certain analysis tools to facilitate and automate certain bits of the process. Most of them are either freemium or have a free trial available, so all that you’ll need to invest into the analysis is your own time. Done properly, competitive analysis will give you plenty of quantitative and qualitative data to back your own business decisions and business strategy (and no, I’m not talking about cloning your competitors’ strategies to come up with a second best product, although this  can  sometimes  work ). Namely, it can help you: I can sense you rolling your eyes at me, but hear me out. If you’re serious about competitive analysis, it’s not enough to just evaluate the two Industry Leaders everyone’s talking about (that kind of analysis will likely get you depressed real quick). The competitors you pick for the analysis determine the insights you’ll get at the end, and the decisions you’ll make, based in part on those insights. That’s why including different kinds of competitors (big and small, direct and indirect) into the analysis is critical if you want the results to be comprehensive. Here’s a handy way to think about your competition that’s based off of  Myk Pono’s classification: It’s best to include at least one competitor from each category into your analysis to make it truly comprehensive. Whether you can instantly think of over a dozen competitors or can barely recall five, it’s a good idea to turn to Google or a different a search engine (DuckDuckGo, anyone?) and look up your product category. Examine the products within the top 50 results, along with the ads that are displayed in response to your query — more likely than not, you’ll come across companies you’ve forgotten about, or maybe even learn about a few newcomers. To give you an example, I’m going to imagine I’m launching a vacation rental website — an alternative to AirBnB. Here’s what my list of competitors may look like broken down by categories: Now that you have a comprehensive list of your competitors with similar products, it’s time to start the actual analysis. As you go through the process, feel free to use  this Google Sheets template I’ve created. In the spreadsheet, I like to divide the factors into collapsable sections (yes, these do get pretty lengthy). I also tend to add comments under each aspect with details or links that provide more info. Depending on the stage you’re at with your business, you can also add in a column for your own product to quickly see how it compares to competitors. I’ll go into depth about each section below, and again feel free to grab this competitor analysis template to follow along. Your analysis should start with digging up the basic info about your competitors: things like the company’s founding year, the names of the CEO and other key people, locations of the company’s offices, how many employees work there, etc. You’ll usually find bits of this information on competitors’ websites. The company’s  LinkedIn profile is often useful, particularly for employee counts. And for info on key people, offices, and founding date,  CrunchBase is a great resource. Your competitors’ job openings can also be found on their websites, LinkedIn, and job search sites like  Glassdoor and  Indeed. Knowing who they are hiring and which teams they are expanding will give you an idea of what steps they’re about to take, both product- and marketing-wise. Are they about to hire their first sales rep or content marketer? Are they looking for a developer with a specific skill set? Combined with what you know about your industry, your competition’s job openings will tell you a lot about where they are going with their business. You could also take things one step further and see if you can get an understanding of competitors’ corporate culture. The best place to dig through employee reviews is  Glassdoor. There, you can find out what employees think about the culture, the team, the pay, the management – and those are often honest opinions because a lot of the feedback is anonymous. Knowing when, how much, and from whom your competitors received funding can also be important, particularly if you plan on raising capital yourself. It will give you a solid idea on how much funding you can expect to get. On top of that, venture capitalists (VCs) tend to invest in only one company in a given category so as not to cannibalize their own investments. If an VCs’ name is missing from your competitors’ funding history, they might be a good candidate for you: they missed out on the chance to work with a successful competitor, but now they have the opportunity to invest into a promising startup in the industry (you!). Your competitors’ revenue and number of customers deserve a separate section in your spreadsheet. For some companies, you’ll be able to find estimates on  Owler , but those will often be very rough. A Google search for the name of your competitor combined with the words “revenue,” “customers,” etc. might lead you to interviews or press releases where the companies share this information (because, well, everyone likes to brag). That said, I bet you won’t be able to find every competitor’s revenue figures this way. To help you dig deeper, I have two hacks to share that go beyond a simple Google search: Hack #1: Set up alerts for competitors’ interviews and conference presentations. This one requires some time, but it’s very effective in the long run: you’ll be surprised at just how much your competitors give away at event presentations and in interviews, without being aware of you listening. All you need to do is sign up for  Awario (there’s a free 14-day trial available), create an alert for the names of your competitors’ CEOs or other key figures (don’t forget to put the names in double quotes to search for an exact match), and select YouTube as the source for the search. And that’s it! You can now binge-watch those videos right in Awario, without having to leave the tool for a minute, noting your findings along the way. Hack #2: Use this revenue formula Jason Lemkin of SaaStr  offers a simple formula you can use to calculate a competitor’s revenue estimate, provided you know how many people work there. Take the number of employees the company has listed on its LinkedIn profile and multiply that by $150,000 if well-funded ($200,000 if modestly funded). This should give you an estimate you can work with. These details, combined with company info like founding year and employee counts, are important so you can use them as a benchmark against your own growth. How much time did it take each of your competitors to get to the revenue figures they have today? Are you doing as well as a current market leader back when it was an early-stage business? It’s time to evaluate your competitors’ products or services, the actual things they’re selling. What kind of technology are they using to build it? What is their core selling point? Are there any perks that come with the product: a freemium version, complementary free tools, or services? Let’s get down to the core of your competitors’ business – their product and its key features. A word of caution: this will likely be the longest bit of your spreadsheet. It’s a good idea to divide the features into groups of related ones to keep things organized. Assessing competitors’ pricing pages is another crucial step in your analysis (if pricing isn’t available on their website, try reaching out to their sales team). Here are some questions to consider: Another thing you can draw from competitors’ pricing strategies is great ideas for A/B testing. Do they offer monthly or annual plans? (If it’s both, what is the default option?) How many packages have they got? Identify the opportunities for your experiments, and prioritize the ones that are common for several competitors. Dig through your competitors’ websites to see if they offer something complimentary with their product. Do they have a free trial or a freemium version? Are there any “free” tools their customers get access to, or perhaps a perks program in partnership with other tools? Competitors’ technology is an important aspect to assess for tech companies. BuiltWith is a great (and free) tool to figure out the tech stack that a competitor uses. Just type in the URL, and you’ll be able to see what technology the website runs on, along with any third-party scripts and plugins it uses, everything from analytics systems, email marketing services, to A/B testing tools, and CRMs. A lean alternative to BuiltWith is What Runs, which is a browser extension that analyzes any webpage you’re on. On top of that, looking at competitors’ job postings (yes, again) is a great way to see what kind of technology stack they’re using by analyzing the skills they require from candidates. To look for job openings, check your competitors’ websites and job search sites like  Glassdoor and  Indeed. Your next big step in analyzing the competition is looking at what their customers have to say about them. In this section, you’ll look at each brand’s Share of Voice, the sentiment behind their mentions, the key topics customers bring up when they talk about your competitors, and more. To measure these, you’ll need a social listening tool like  Awario or Mention. Ideally, you’d want to measure the market share for each of your competitors. But alas, it’s nearly impossible. One substitute metric you could use is Share of Voice – the volume of mentions your competitors get on social media and the web compared to each other. To measure share of voice, create an alert for each competitor’s brand in Awario, give the tool some time to collect the mentions, and jump to the  Alert Comparison report to see how much each competitor is talked about on social and the web. It’s a good idea to keep these alerts running for the long-term (as opposed to just looking at Share of Voice once). This way, you’ll be able to see spikes in their volume of mentions, track what their customers are saying, and see how their (and your own) Share of Voice evolves over time. The caveat of measuring the level of awareness a competitor has is that awareness isn’t always a good thing. What if there’s been a data scandal one of the competitors is involved in? What if their customer service is horrible, causing an influx of negative mentions? That’s not the only reason why measuring the sentiment behind the mentions of your competitors is important. It will also help you understand what these companies’ customers love and hate about their product the most. On top of that, it can also serve as a benchmark when you analyze the sentiment behind the mentions of your own brand and product. Let’s say, 40% of your mentions are positive, 20% are negative, and the rest are neutral. How do you know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing without a benchmark? What do your customers focus on when they mention your competitors’ products or write customer reviews? What do they love and hate the most? Identifying the key topics within your competitors’ mentions will give quick answers to these questions so you don’t have to dig through mentions by hand. You can find these topic clouds in a social listening dashboard. From there, you can click on any topic to explore the mentions in-depth. Interestingly, these topic clouds can also offer insight into various aspects of your competitors’ business – and they may help you fill the gaps in other sections in your competitor analysis spreadsheet. Here’s one example: those are the key topics for Loom, a screen recording app, from which you can learn a few useful things if you look closely. Looks like the company a) has just raised some money, b) offers remote jobs, and c) has just announced a new feature they’re building. And you discovered all that at a glance! Of course, you can further explore any topic by clicking on it to see all the mentions that contain the word/phrase. Looking at the geography and demographics of your competitors’ mentions will let you figure out which markets they are focusing on the most (and, with any luck, find an area that isn’t too saturated yet). You’ll find a map of each brand’s mentions in Awario’s dashboard and reports, along with the breakdown of mentions by language. Try adjusting the date range in the report to see if there’s been any changes in languages/countries recently. This could mean that your competitors are focusing on a new emerging market – an opportunity you might be interested to explore. Just like with geography, this one will give you an idea on where your competitors’ audience hangs out so you can use these findings in your own marketing strategy and social media strategy. On top of that, if you see platforms that appear to be heavily underused (but do look relevant), those may also be worth experimenting with. Just like with the previous factors, you can compare the platforms side-by-side using Awario’s  Alert Comparison report. From the SEO perspective, there are two most important things about competition you should focus on: the keywords they rank for and the backlinks they’ve got. The former will give you a solid idea on what type of search terms bring them traffic and sales (so you can shape your own keyword strategy), and the latter will show what authoritative websites in your niche link to them (those will likely be relevant to your website too). For both tasks, you can use  SEO PowerSuite (you can get the free version  here ). The toolkit includes 4 apps for different aspects of SEO, but we’ll only need 2 of those to analyze competitors. Rank Tracker will help you with the keywords. Navigate to the tool’s  Ranking Keywords module and type in a competitor’s URL. You’ll see a list of terms they rank for, along with the search volume for each term in your country of choice. It’s a good idea to move the most popular terms to  Target Keywords right away so you can keep them for your records. Repeat the process for every competitor, noting their estimated search traffic and top keywords they rank for. For backlink analysis, you’ll need SEO SpyGlass. Launch the tool and create a project for one of your competitors. Next, jump to  Domain Comparison . One by one, specify your competitors’ websites and take a look at how they compare. Next, jump to  Link Intersection – a module that shows you the domains that link to more than one of your competitors. You can sort them by InLink Rank to see the most authoritative websites on your list. Those are likely relevant industry websites that will make a great addition to your backlink profile – make sure to save them so you can reach out and see if you can get a backlink from there. The next step is analyzing what, when, and how your competitors are doing on social media. Rival IQ is a useful tool for this task, and they have a 14-day free trial available. Once you’ve signed up for the tool, specify your competitors’ websites, and the platform will automatically pull their social media profiles. From there, you’ll be able to see which social networks they’re active on, how many followers they have, how much engagement their posts get, etc. Those insights will be handy to benchmark your own strategy against. The tool will also show you the best times and days of the week to post, based on the engagement competitors’ posts get. On top of that, it may be a good idea to research if your competitors have a community on social media – a Facebook group or a subreddit dedicated to their product. How big is the community? Are the users engaged? To get an idea of your competitors’ ad strategy,  SimilarWeb is a great (and free) starting point. Enter the URL of a competitor’s website and navigate to the  Search  section – it will show you if your competitors have any search ads running, and, if they do, what their target keywords are. The  Display  section below will show you whether a competitor is running any display ads, and, if they are, which platforms bring them the most traffic. For Facebook ads, simply open a competitor’s Facebook page and click on  Info and ads . Alternatively, you can use Facebook’s  Ad Library to search for your competitors’ ads. Unfortunately, these tools won’t reveal targeting rules your competitors use, but you’ll still get a solid idea of how many ads they’re running, and perhaps get inspiration for your own advertising efforts. If native ads or other kinds of paid content are a thing in your niche, you can also try searching for “sponsored by [competitor]”, “author” “[competitor]”, etc. in a search engine of your choice (the quotes will make sure you’re looking for an exact match, and all of the words in the query are taken into account). Take note of authoritative platforms you come across and try reaching out to them to inquire about sponsored posts. At this point, we’re interested in exploring the partnerships your competitors have that help spread the word about their products. We’ll look at influencers endorsing your competition, publishers they work with, and media platforms they guest blog on, if any. For the analysis, you’ll need the same social media monitoring alerts for your competitors’ brand you’ve already created in Awario. In your feed, make sure to group the mentions by Authors and sort them by Reach to see the most influential posts first (Reach is calculated based on the number of followers and engagements on social media, and based on the site’s estimated traffic for results from news, blogs, and the web). This will let you see the most influential posts that mention your competition, including social media posts and blog articles from around the web. Take note of the influencers or publishers they work with – chances are they will be happy to work with you as well. On top of that, you can also turn to SimilarWeb to see what referral sources are bringing the most visits to your competitors’ websites. Chances are you’ll also find a bunch of blogs and media platforms that generate substantial traffic to their sites. If content is part of your competitors’ strategy, it’s important that you analyze their blog and what they tend to write about. Are the readers engaged? Do the posts get shared around social media a lot? Does the competitor accept guest posts? BuzzSumo is a great tool to help you out. It will show you the most shared posts on any blog within the past year, so you can get inspiration for your own posts and a better idea of what kind of content resonates with your target audience the best. I know, a lot of the points above were actually customer acquisition techniques; but this section is reserved for the ones that weren’t outlined before. Do your competitors have a referral strategy? Do they have an affiliate program? Do they sponsor or exhibit at industry conferences? Do they acquire customers in any other creative way? If applicable, it’s also important to analyze your competitors’ sales strategy. Do they do product demos? What does contacting a rep look like? Is there a phone number you can call? The best thing to do is try and book a demo (or a call) with every company yourself, taking careful note of every step. Do they require filling out dozens of fields for you to talk to sales? Will they refuse to hold a demo just because your company is “too small”? Is their time zone convenient? How long does it take them to reply? All of this will help you spot strengths and weaknesses in your competitors’ sales strategy to help you shape your own. Does every competitor offer Customer Support for all customers, or does it start with a particular plan? What channels do they provide support on: is it email, live chat, phone, social media, or all of the above? What is their response time? Do they offer Account Management for Enterprise customers? Analyzing your competitors’ customer service will help you improve your own. The truth is, in large companies, customer care is often almost non-existent; for a new business in the industry, that’s a great area to capitalize on. If that’s true in your case, make sure to highlight the quality of your customer service on your website. Is there anything else that gives a competitor on your list an unfair advantage over everyone else? For example, is their CEO or somebody else on the team an industry influencer? Does the company  publish amazing books that are also free? Have the founders launched successful products before? Make note of each competitor’s unique strengths that are hard to emulate. Once you’re done with every step of competitive analysis, I’m sure you’ve got a clear understanding of the market and more than a handful of ideas on how to improve your own product. While the research is still fresh in your mind, one bonus step I’d highly recommend to everyone performing the analysis is to map your competitors on a Strategy Canvas (from the book  Blue Ocean Strategy ). A Strategy Canvas is a chart that breaks down your competitors by various aspects of their businesses and products (the pricing and other aspects specific to your product category). The easiest way to plot this is a line chart, with each factor assigned a score depending on how well it is executed. Here’s an example from the book: a Strategy Canvas for Southwest, one of the first low-cost airlines in the US, compared to the 2 categories that could be considered its competitors: air travel at the time and car travel. Source:  Blue Ocean Strategy Depending on the kind of competitors you’ve analyzed, you’ll likely see that most of them follow one or two distinct patterns: those will be the major categories you’re competing with (though they may not be as different as cars and airplanes). It’s time to plot your own product on the canvas and see how it compares to the competitors. Finally, think of ways to make your product stand out. From your research, recall the things your audience needs more and less of.  Blue Ocean Strategy offers a nice way to think about the factors on the canvas in terms of applying them to your own product, called the Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid. Remember: the idea of a competitive analysis isn’t to steal what they’re doing, it is to understand where your business falls in the market and find new opportunities to make your product stand out. Eventually, focusing on your customers and gaps between supply and demand will serve you much better than focusing on the competition. And that’s what competitor analysis is for – finding ways to serve the customer better.

It helps you understand how challenging it could be to crack a market, what strategies could work, and how you can best position your brand. It can also tell you what strategies won’t work, what the customer’s expectations are and how much they’re willing to pay. Without it, you likely won’t survive a day in a new market. You need to study your competition not only when you’re starting out but also periodically after cementing your feet in the market. This way, you can stay on top of your game, consistently growing your market share. Not sure where to start? We’ve got an easy, 6-step competitor analysis template for you in this guide. We’ll also share templates to help you document your findings. Sign up. It’s free.  What Is a Competitor Analysis? The Benefits of Competitor Analysis for Businesses How To Conduct a Competitor Analysis (Step-by-Step) 10 Competitor Analysis Templates To Use Right Away Ready To Try Out This Competitor Analysis Template?  Competitor analysis is the strategic research of your competitors to study their strengths and weaknesses. By taking the time to analyze your current and potential competitors, you can identify areas for improvement. You want to look out for things like their value proposition, product, marketing and sales tactics.  Besides helping you find gaps in the market, studying your competition helps in the following ways:  A competitor analysis seeks to study all available information on your competitors, including their pricing, differentiators, positioning, product portfolio, strengths and weaknesses. The steps below will help you uncover all this and more. Chances are you can recall who your competitors are in a breath. But if you’re new, identifying who your direct and indirect competitors are will take some time. Keep in mind that direct competitors offer products and services similar to yours, positioning them as a substitute for your business. They also mostly target the same audience. On the flip side, indirect competitors are businesses that don’t necessarily offer the same product or service. However, their offering can solve the same customer problem that your business solves. An easy, cost-effective way to identify competitors is by typing in your product type into the Google search bar. Let’s suppose you have a project management software. A quick Google search on this will turn up names of companies offering the same type of software. For creating a comprehensive list of competitors, make sure you google synonyms too. This could be a “project management tool” for the example above. Another useful tactic is to conduct the same research on social media. Type in what your business does and you’ll see similar business names pop up. You can also surf hashtags to learn how other companies are using them. Lastly, if you’re conducting market research interviews, pay attention to the brand names that target buyers mention in their interviews. Once you know who your competitors are, start studying them one by one. Go through their product portfolio. Look at the products they offer, how they position and price them. Record your findings in a worksheet so you can track and analyze the data you’re gathering. Visme allows you to do this quickly and easily. You can also grab a template from Visme’s template gallery and create a product and pricing sketch for each competitor. This will make it easy for you to visualize individual competitors. To determine competitors’ market share, use Statista or a similar resource to get your hands on the numbers. Track and visualize your findings in this template. A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis helps you study what competitors are doing to win customers. You can also use it to identify gaps in your market. For example, let's say a competitor’s customer support team takes pretty long to get back to customers. You can use the information to provide faster customer support and a better experience for customers. As you hunt for competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, study the following areas: Running an ecommerce business? Study competitors’ shipping and product return strategies as well. An effective way to jump-start studying competitors’ strengths, weaknesses and more is through social listening. The goal? To identify what customers are saying about brands on social media channels they use, including chat forums and groups they are a part of. A similar approach is to study customer reviews. This will help you understand what your competitors’ customers are saying about them. Are they satisfied with the product quality? Or are they put off by their onboarding process? Do their support requests take long to get answered? As you go about researching, record your findings in a SWOT analysis template like this one: If you’re a Visme user, you have the benefit of coordinating your SWOT research efforts with your team. If you and your business partner are working together on the research work, you can both access and edit the worksheet in Visme at the same time. To do this, use the Share option from the top right side of your project dashboard in Visme. Select ""Share Privately"" and add your partner to the project. From there, you two can collaborate on design, leaving comments for each other. We’ve already mentioned that you need to make notes on how your competitors price their products. But studying their pricing strategy goes deeper. First, review what discounts competitors offer. Then look at how often they offer discounts. Studying your competitors’ promo strategies will help you understand how they’re attracting customers and growing sales. It will also give you a good idea of how much the target market is willing to pay and what their expectations are in terms of discounts. In addition to the manual research to uncover individual competitor pricing, use the same research tools mentioned above — social listening and customer reviews. They'll help identify what customers are saying. Pay attention to how customers respond to the discounts and promotions that competitors run. Some businesses tend to offer discounts shortly after they launch new products. This can be a turn-off for shoppers who like to shop for the latest collections to stand out from their peers. Similarly, other businesses extend product deals now and then despite telling customers it’s their last chance to buy. See if and how that annoys customers and if there’s an opportunity for you to offer something more relevant and unique to the target market. It’s important to study how competitors are raising brand awareness and moving leads down their marketing funnel. Begin by identifying where your leading competitors are funneling their resources. Is it PPC they’re investing in? Or are they taking the community-building approach to attract, engage and nurture customers? Chances are your competitors are big on educating customers, so they’re investing in content marketing. Also, look at which channels competitors are focusing on. Is it Twitter or Reddit? Or do they have a strong presence on Instagram? The answer to this will help you understand where your target audience is present and which marketing channels you should focus on. Take Clearscope, an SEO content optimization tool, for example. They take an educational approach to their marketing by creating lots of webinar content. Source Ahrefs, another SEO tool, on the other hand, is also big on the educational approach. But they create blog content, not webinars. Source In this last step, compile all your research in written format. Create an action plan that includes a tactical list of steps to take. This way, you can discuss and prioritize steps to take with your team. Aim to be concise as you create this competitor analysis document. If you create a wordy report, nobody will read it. But if you create a document that summarizes your findings and visualizes data in the form of charts and graphs, more people will read and appreciate your hard work. Want some good news? Visme makes it uber-simple to create easy-to-read graphs and charts. It can help you create an easily shareable and visually engaging analysis document. Design graphs using templates like the one below: Alternatively, create new charts in your presentation or report. All you have to do is to head to Charts & Graphs on the left side of your design dashboard and choose the type of chart you want to create. From there, Visme gives you a chart to enter data so it can create a custom graph for your project. You can resize the graph you create, tweak its color, animate it and add other interacgive effects. When you are done designing your document you can easily share it with the rest of your team. Head to the Share button at the top right corner of your design dashboard. Now select Share Privately from the left side and give permission to team members. Choose whether they can view your work, comment on it, or edit it. If you prefer to get a link for the work you’ve created, simply grab it from the bottom of the page and share it with your team. By going into Advanced Settings on the left side, followed by Privacy. You can also allow your team to download the competitor analysis report as a PDF.  And, finally, for the templates that we promised: Use this infographic template to record your competitors’ pricing, unique selling proposition (USP), revenue and more. Since the information is arranged in a table format, you can easily study how each competitor stands against another and how they compare to business. If you’re looking to pitch some growth ideas to your executive team, this interactive competitor analysis template is for you. It’s neatly designed so that all information is easy to read. There are a handful of slides in the template that use tables to compare competitors. You can also always add more slides or remove some to suit your needs. This is the perfect template for studying and comparing two competitors. If you prefer, you can also use the beautifully designed template to analyze your business against your leading competitor. And if need be, you can add another row for comparing another competitor. This is another competitor analysis template to pitch two competitors against one another. What makes it different from the template above is that it arranges all the comparative pointers at the center. This way, you won’t need to keep looking to the left side to see which pointer you’re studying. This is a great template to record findings on each competitor. By using it, you can easily get a snapshot of each of your competitor’s free and paid products, USP, features, target market and the marketing channels they use. This template is perfect for recording not just your competitors’ products, features and pricing but also their SWOT analysis. Consequently, this competitor analysis template can serve as your readable database with all your research findings. If you’re looking to record your competitor’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, then this template is perfect. And if you’re conducting several competitors’ SWOT analyses, make sure you use this template for each one of them. This competitor analysis template is useful for comparing your business with your leading competition. As well as a comparative table, it also features space to record other essential details such as company overview, key differentiators, customer pain points and benefits. This one is a simple, minimally-designed competitor analysis template for comparing various competitors. If you need to add another column, you can easily do so by editing the template in Visme. Lastly, we’ve got this competitor analysis template. Its best feature is that the template divides each column into sub-categories, which makes it easy to analyze each aspect. For example, within the product column, you can easily learn about a competitor’s product features, pricing and USP.  So you see, competitor analysis is critical for tapping into and growing in a market. But remember, analyzing your competitors and their moves is only part of the task. The other part involves documenting your findings in an easy-to-read and understandable way. This is key to making sure your team implements the findings from the research.

As a 12-year-old, this news meant the end of walking down aisles with my family, looking for the perfect weekend flick. But to Netflix, this meant their competitive market analysis had paid off. Competitor analysis is all about becoming aware of who you are as an organization in relation to the competition. It's key to learning, growing, and staying ahead, especially in a volatile industry that has to evolve and innovate with new tech. As much as I miss my three-day VHS and DVD rentals, video entertainment has improved significantly, thanks to innovation and competitive pressure. Your industry isn't immune to change either, which is why it's so important to get ahead. Table of contents: What is a competitive analysis? The importance of competitive analysis in marketing How to conduct competitive market analysis in 6 steps Competitive analysis example Internal operations as a competitive advantage Competitive market analysis is the process of determining who your competitors are, researching their strategies, and unpacking what they do well (and not so well). From this process, you can learn a lot about your company's own strengths and weaknesses, as well as how to remain a strong competitor in your industry. A deep dive into your competitors' strategies will reveal their product offerings, mission statements, target markets, marketing strategies, and more. You may even identify new competitors you didn't know existed. The greats learn from the greats. Yes, you're trying to beat your competitors, but that doesn't mean you can't learn from them—especially if they've been around the block a few times. Seeing what works for your competitors will point toward gaps in your own strategies (as well as gaps in their strategies)—and ideally give you some inspiration on how to fill those gaps. Competitive market analysis isn't just about understanding specific competitors. It can also uncover the direction that an entire industry is moving. For example, Blockbuster didn't move with the industry, and we all know how that ended. Competitive analysis can help you avoid that same fate. By analyzing competitors, you uncover customer pain points they might've missed, allowing you to refine your product's value and directly address those needs. It's not just about watching rivals, but seizing opportunities to stand out. By examining market leaders, you define bold markers for your growth, and you can emulate their tactics. You can also employ AI-driven tools like Google Analytics' predictive metrics, HubSpot's forecasting tools, or IBM Watson's analytics. These tools can decipher market patterns, anticipate future prospects, and help you set precise KPIs. With AI's assistance, you can unearth data-driven insights and opportunities even top-tier competitors might miss. Competitive market analysis isn't just a matter of making sure you have a unique selling point. Here's how to dig into the competition and figure out where you stand—and how to stand out. Start by creating a comprehensive list of everyone operating in your industry. You can weed out the less relevant competitors later, but for now, jot down anyone that offers similar products or services. If you're a small local business, your competitors are located nearby—you probably know a lot about them, but at the very least, you know they exist. But for something like an eCommerce store or online service, it's important to figure out who your competitors even are. Start with basic keyword research. Google your product category a few different ways, maybe with words like ""price,"" ""cheap,"" or ""sale"" to reinforce the commercial nature of your query. This will help you identify any competitors and can shed some light on how saturated your industry is. Next, categorize the companies you identify into direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors provide similar products or services to a target market similar to yours. For example, Gucci and Prada both offer high-end clothing and accessories to fashion-conscious consumers with high disposable income. Indirect competitors provide different products or services (though ones that land in the same category as yours) to a target market similar to yours. For example, gyms and companies producing at-home workout equipment can be considered indirect competitors. As the name suggests, direct competitors tend to pose a more direct risk to your business. That said, indirect competitors can still attract customers and pull business away from you. You need to identify and analyze both to truly understand your competitive landscape. Sometimes, a competitor's target market is clear—especially if it's a niche brand. Take Dick's Sporting Goods—it's pretty obvious that they're targeting people who are into sports (or who want to be). For other companies, it isn't as obvious. To determine your competitors' target markets, try the following: Study their mission statement: Sometimes, a company's mission statement will explicitly state who their products and/or services are designed for. And even when it isn't explicit, it will almost certainly provide a hint. Navigate to the ""About"" page on their website, and soak up whatever insight you can. Analyze their voice and tone: Stoic or cheeky? Packed with jargon or written for the novice? Your competitors' tone and wording have a purpose—to get through to their target market. Read company blog posts, join their newsletters, and watch promotional video content, all the while paying close attention to who they seem to be speaking to. Pay attention to their social media engagement: Observe who comments on their content and how they respond to those comments. The influencers they partner with can also shed light on the audience they want to reach. Competitive market analysis requires you to analyze your competitors' four P's of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion. The best way to learn about your competitors' customer experiences is to become a customer yourself. You'll gain incredible insights into what's working for them—and more importantly, where there's room to offer something better. Whenever possible, give your competitors' products a spin. Get a free trial or even buy or sign up for the real deal, if your budget allows. When using their products, try contacting their customer support for additional insight. Pricing can be one of the most sensitive aspects of marketing. For this reason, you need to understand and track what your competition is doing with their pricing. Here are some questions to ask yourself about each competitor: What's their pricing model? Subscription-style, one-time purchase, or a mix of both? Do they seem to be using skim pricing or penetration pricing? Does their pricing model seem to align with the rest of the industry? There are many tools out there to help, as well as specialized tools for specific industries, like hotel room price monitoring. Once you have a grip on your competitors' pricing strategies, here are your options: Reduce your prices: If pricing is the only differentiator in your industry (meaning product, place, and promotion strategies are all pretty uniform), you may consider lowering your prices to snag a higher share of the market. But be wary about how this will impact customers' perceptions of your quality, as well as the risk of a price reduction competition, driving everyone's prices to unprofitable levels. Raise your prices: If your business already leads the market by providing something unique or higher-quality products than the competition, you may consider raising your prices. Be mindful of the price elasticity of your product before pursuing this strategy, as a small price increase can lose customers in certain industries. Match your competitors' pricing: It's much more challenging to sell products at the same price as competitors. This strategy works if your business has been in the market for a while and can make a unique or niche offer. In this case, the customer will decide to purchase based on personal preferences rather than the price. If you feel like none of the above strategies will work for you, you might explore nontraditional pricing structures like bundling. Where are your competitors selling? Is everything online, or do they have brick-and-mortar stores? Every industry trends differently here—shoe brands, for example, tend to have some in-person outlets since most people want to try on a pair of shoes before buying them. Furniture stores, on the other hand, don't always rely on brick-and-mortar locations. They can provide pictures, videos, and product details (such as dimensions and materials) to provide customers with a ""good enough"" idea of what they're getting. Promotion encompasses more than just advertising, but since advertising is so measurable and public, it's the easiest to spy on. To avoid wasting your advertising budget, analyze your competitors' strategies. Here's what you're looking for: Cost per click: If the CPC is too high, you may not want to use paid ads as a promotion channel at all. It's better to learn this from your competitors than from your own experience. Keywords: Examine the competition level for each keyword in your competitors' ad campaigns. This will help you find the best-performing keywords with low competition (and that means lower cost per click). You'll also be able to see which keywords aren't doing well and avoid those. Long-running ads: If your competitor keeps running the same campaign for a long time, it definitely works for them. You can try to create something similar to replicate their success. If most competitors rely on social media advertisements as opposed to TV or print ads, you should probably follow suit. Likewise, if they're putting their entire budget into advertising how crispy their chicken sandwich is, it's probably because chicken sandwich consumers really like their chicken crispy. Watch how your competitors allocate their advertising budget and use that information to inform your own strategy. SEO is a beast, and there's no surefire way to fully dissect your competitors' strategy. But there are a few ways to at least figure out what's working for them. Use a keyword research tool to see what topics your competitors are ranking for. Do they rely entirely on industry-specific queries, or do they branch into other tangential topics? What pages are bringing in the most traffic? By discovering which keywords your competitors target (and rank for), you get insight into what's working for them and uncover new keywords you might have neglected. Even better, you might also find keywords they aren't targeting and identify the underserved customers. You can also use it as a chance to differentiate your message so that you're ranking for more targeted keywords. The Ahrefs screenshot below shows the highest-traffic-driving pages from Slack's blog. A competing communication platform could use this data to learn what's working for Slack and replicate their success. To really be successful, however, you need to one-up the competition, bringing something new to the table. Ahrefs also lets you see your competitors' backlinks. Figure out which websites are already linking to your competitors, and then you can try to get yourself a backlink from those sites as well. Pro tip: As you do this research, actually click into some of your competitors' high-ranking pages to see what exactly is attracting users (and Google). Data is crucial, but nothing can replace the human eye. If you can figure out which types of content—blog posts, videos, podcasts, guides, etc.—are most popular with your competitors' audiences, that can help inform your own content strategy. And here's a tech twist: you can employ ChatGPT to run a content analysis. Simply plug in a piece of content, ask it to run the analysis, and it will quickly dissect the post, highlighting themes, patterns, and potential gaps your brand can capitalize on. The goal is to identify which content types get the most traffic or engagement. You can use a marketing analytics tool to analyze both of those things: Do the highest-performing pieces of content tend to all be one specific medium (video, infographic, written content, or something else)? Do the titles of the most-shared articles all have numbers or other specific characters (like brackets or hyphens) in them? Is the most-shared content all about a similar topic? Let's say you run a travel blog and discover that your competitor's article called ""How to save money for a trip"" is super popular among their audience. You now have an opportunity to create content on a similar topic but make it even better. Maybe ""The ultimate guide to traveling on a budget"" or even a real story about ""How 21-year-old Mike saved $10K for his epic adventure."" You should also be following all your competitors to learn more about their social media strategy, including which platforms work best for them. Social media presents an opportunity to let your brand's voice and personality shine. Take Wendy's, for example. The brand publicly roasts its competitors on X (Twitter), and the internet loves it. Not every brand can (or should) be quite as blunt and sassy as Wendy's, but showing some personality can pay off. A SWOT analysis is a great way to spot opportunities to capitalize on and threats to prepare for before they strike. In short: Strengths (S) and weaknesses (W) look internally at your company. Opportunities (O) and threats (T) look externally to the industry and market. While diving into your competitive market analysis, consider these factors: Market share percentage: This metric reflects the proportion of sales a company has in the industry compared to its competitors. Tools like Statista or market research reports can offer insights into a brand's dominance or underperformance. Competitive features: Understand the unique offerings that set a product or service apart from its rivals. Customer surveys and product comparison charts are useful methods to determine standout features. Company culture: A company's values, work environment, and ethics can be a deciding factor for customers. Monitoring employer review sites like Glassdoor or observing a company's interactions on social media can provide insights. Customer reviews: Customer reviews provide direct feedback on a product or service's quality and the company's reputation. Platforms like Yelp, Trustpilot, or Google Reviews offer a treasure trove of customer sentiments and concerns. Geography (if applicable): Location can be pivotal in a company's success, especially for local businesses. Using tools like Google Trends can help identify where a product or brand is most popular geographically. Let's be clear—this isn't going to shine a spotlight on the exact strategy you should pursue to beat your competitors. What it can do is provide a high-level look at your internal and external environment, making it easier to piece together your competitive strategy. When promoting your brand, you're thinking about how to communicate your strengths. Conducting a SWOT analysis forces you to also view your brand with scrutiny. You may be working toward being ""the best"" at everything, but there will inevitably be things that other brands do better. Download our SWOT analysis template and follow along with the example below to learn as much as possible about your brand and your competitive environment. You can also kick-start the process using ChatGPT. Let's say you're the CEO of an automotive company conducting a competitive analysis. After doing a deep dive into your competition and your industry as a whole, organizing your notes and SWOT analyses in folders labeled by competitor, you notice a huge push toward electric vehicles. In fact, you estimate that your closest competitor (who targets the same market as you) now allocates over half of its advertising budget to its newest electric vehicle release. But you only have one electric vehicle option, and you only allocate 15% of your advertising budget toward it. You reasonably guess that you're in trouble. Additional research confirms your market is very interested in making the switch to electric. You decide to reallocate your budget toward researching, producing, and promoting electric vehicles. Five years pass, and you realize you would have been left in the dust had you failed to analyze the competition or ignored the warning signs. Competitive market analysis can prevent wasted resources, inspire new opportunities, and help you stay one step ahead of the competition. Take these six steps to better understand your company's strengths and weaknesses—then identify where you need to improve and how to invest your resources to remain a strong competitor in your industry. Sometimes, a company's competitive advantage comes from its seamless internal operations. It can be hard to find out what's going on internally at another company, but you can be sure you streamline your own processes.
